ADV. GEETHA RAJ
MANIFESTO FOR THE BAR
“Welfare with Dignity • Justice with Speed • Practice with Protection”
VISION STATEMENT
Adv. Geetha Raj envisions a progressive, accountable, and future-ready Bar Council that genuinely protects its members while strengthening the delivery of justice. Under the guiding banner “Welfare with Dignity • Justice with Speed • Practice with Protection,” her vision is to build a Bar where every advocate, and every advocate’s family, is treated with respect, fairness, and urgency.
This vision bridges modern advocacy with grassroots support, ensuring that even the most vulnerable lawyers have swift access to welfare benefits, comprehensive health security, and meaningful post-practice protection, while also safeguarding the integrity of the legal profession against misuse, impersonation, and unauthorised practice.
It is a vision of courts where women advocates work in safe and inclusive environments, young lawyers are mentored rather than marginalised, professional dignity is upheld, and dispute resolution is efficient, ethical, and dignified, supported by a Bar Council that actively engages with institutions of the State to protect justice from within.
A future-ready Bar must protect advocates not only in court, but in health, hardship, and retirement. Welfare without security is incomplete.
MISSION STATEMENT
Adv. Geetha Raj’s mission is to translate vision into action by reforming Bar welfare systems, strengthening professional security, mentoring the next generation of advocates, and streamlining the administration of justice. Drawing on her decades of courtroom experience, institutional representation, and insurance-law expertise, she is committed to delivering measurable outcomes rather than rhetoric.
Her mission includes modernising Bar administration through transparency and technology, establishing robust support structures for young and women advocates, institutionalising health insurance, pension security, and advocate-protection frameworks, and strengthening mediation and pro bono services so that justice reaches every citizen.
Equally, she is committed to active legislative and policy engagement, working with Bar Associations and State institutions to eliminate unauthorised practice of law, protect advocates from violence and intimidation, and reinforce public trust in the legal profession. Through accountable governance and consistent institutional dialogue, she aims to restore confidence in the Bar Council as a body that truly serves, protects, and empowers its members.

Institutional Leadership & Professional Recognition
Early in her professional career, Adv. Geetha Raj was elected as an Office Bearer of the Indian Federation of Women Lawyers (IFWL), through a democratic process among its members. During her tenure, she actively contributed to strengthening professional capacity within the Bar by organising multiple workshops and training programmes for advocates across Karnataka, in collaboration with the Karnataka Judicial Academy. These initiatives focused on practical courtroom skills, legal updates, and professional development, reflecting her early and sustained commitment to collective institutional growth and peer-driven leadership.

Adv. Geetha Raj currently serves her second consecutive term as an elected Director on the Board of Nyayamitra Sahakari Bank, a cooperative bank established and run by the advocate fraternity. Her election to the Board through member voting reflects the trust and confidence reposed in her by the advocate community. During her tenure, she has been actively involved in streamlining banking operations, strengthening internal governance, and improving service delivery to advocate-members.

Under the collective stewardship of the Board, the Bank has:
1. expanded financial support to members through housing loans, mortgage loans, and auto loans,

CORE COMMITMENTS
1.	Welfare That Works.
i.	The Karnataka Advocates’ Welfare Fund rests on strong statutory foundations, but its effectiveness depends on timely delivery, procedural clarity, and last-mile access. Adv. Geetha Raj is committed to reforming the welfare system so that welfare benefits reach advocates and their families with certainty, dignity, and urgency.
ii.	She will work to institutionalise time-bound processing of welfare claims, with clearly defined stages, submission, scrutiny, approval, and disbursal, supported by transparent timelines and accountability mechanisms. This will replace uncertainty and delay with predictability and trust.
iii.	To ensure accessible support, Welfare Helpdesks will be established at Bar Associations across the State, enabling advocates and their families to receive local guidance on welfare entitlements, documentation, and record updates without unnecessary travel or intermediaries.
iv.	A dedicated Family-First Protocol will prioritise and fast-track welfare benefits to the families of deceased advocates, providing hand-holding assistance and sensitive processing during periods of vulnerability. In parallel, “Know Your Welfare Rights” awareness initiatives will be undertaken so that no advocate or dependent is deprived of statutory benefits due to procedural or informational gaps.
v.	Through these measures, welfare will function not as a formality, but as a reliable system of support for advocates and their families across all stages of professional life.
2.	Comprehensive Medical Insurance for Advocates and Their Families.

i.	Access to affordable and reliable healthcare is no longer optional, it is essential professional security. Adv. Geetha Raj will work toward the introduction of Bar-wide group medical insurance schemes covering advocates, their spouses, children, and dependent parents, ensuring that health crises do not become financial catastrophes for advocates’ families.
ii.	Her focus will be on negotiating group Mediclaim arrangements with both public and private insurers, leveraging pooled risk to secure lower premiums, broader coverage, and access to cashless treatment across major hospital networks. Coverage will include hospitalisation, critical illness, maternity benefits, and essential post-hospitalisation care.
iii.	Recognising the diversity within the Bar, the insurance framework will be designed with tiered and optional plans, enabling young advocates, women advocates, and senior practitioners to choose coverage aligned with their stage of life and professional capacity. Continuity of coverage will be a guiding principle, ensuring that advocates are not excluded due to illness, maternity, or temporary interruptions in practice.
iv.	Drawing on her professional experience in insurance litigation and advisory work, Adv. Geetha Raj is committed to ensuring that this initiative is practical, transparent, and enforceable in real life, with an emphasis on claims honouring and grievance redressal, not merely policy promises.

3.	Pension and Post-Practice Security for Advocates (Including Women Advocates)
i.	The assumption that an advocate can or should practise until death is neither humane nor reflective of present realities. Ill-health, age, caregiving responsibilities, and changing professional capacities affect advocates as they do any other profession. A Bar that speaks for justice must therefore also ensure dignity, continuity, and security for its own members beyond active practice.
ii.	Adv. Geetha Raj will initiate a structured, transparent, and consultative process to evolve a Pension and Post-Practice Security Framework for advocates, rooted in voluntariness, fairness, and long-term sustainability. This framework will be developed in consultation with senior advocates, Bar Associations, actuarial and financial experts, and relevant government stakeholders, ensuring both professional acceptance and financial prudence.
iii.	The proposed approach will explore voluntary and choice-based pension contributions during active years of practice, with flexible contribution tiers aligned to years of practice and earning capacity. Special safeguards will be incorporated for women advocates, particularly those who experience career interruptions due to marriage, maternity, or caregiving responsibilities, so that such life events do not result in lifelong insecurity.
iv.	Clear and dignified exit and transition mechanisms will also be examined, including options such as voluntary dormancy or surrender of Sanad upon retirement and eligibility-based activation of pension benefits thereafter. The guiding principle of this initiative is security with dignity, not coercion, ensuring that retirement from practice does not mean abandonment by the profession.

4.	Pressuring the State for Statutory Protection :  

Medical insurance and pension security for advocates cannot depend on goodwill, fragmented schemes, or ad-hoc announcements. They require statutory recognition, sustained policy backing, and institutional accountability. A profession entrusted with protecting constitutional rights must itself be protected through law.
Adv. Geetha Raj commits to using the institutional authority and collective voice of the Bar Council to engage decisively with the State Government for:
1.	statutory medical insurance support for advocates and their families,
2.	structured government participation or subsidies in advocate pension frameworks, and
3.	formal recognition of advocates as a professional class entitled to social security protection.
She will also work in coordination with other State Bar Councils and the Bar Council of India to build a national advocacy framework for long-term legislative protection of advocates. Advocates protect the justice system; the justice system, in turn, must protect advocates.


5.	Advocate Protection and Security Framework

Financial security alone is insufficient if advocates remain vulnerable to physical threats, professional intimidation, and retaliation for discharging their duties. The independence of the Bar, and by extension, the administration of justice, depends on the ability of advocates to practise without fear.
Adv. Geetha Raj will work toward the establishment of a formal Advocate Protection and Security Framework, recognising that attacks on advocates are not private disputes but assaults on the justice delivery system itself. This framework will institutionalise coordinated responses to threats, harassment, and violence against advocates, ensuring that such incidents are addressed swiftly, seriously, and transparently.
The framework will provide for structured coordination with police and district administrations, clear response protocols when advocates are targeted for professional work, and consistent institutional representation before the government and judiciary. Through sustained engagement and policy advocacy, Adv. Geetha Raj will reinforce a zero-tolerance approach to intimidation or violence against advocates, safeguarding professional dignity and fearless advocacy.

6.	Young Advocates First

The strength and future of the legal profession depend on how its youngest members are trained, supported, and retained. Early-career advocates require practical skills, ethical grounding, and economic stability, not symbolic assurances.
Adv. Geetha Raj will prioritise young advocates by establishing a structured mentorship and practice-support ecosystem that bridges the gap between legal education and courtroom realities. A formal Mentorship Network will pair experienced advocates with juniors to impart practical knowledge in drafting, procedure, courtroom conduct, and professional ethics.
Regular Practice-Support Clinics will focus on core areas of daily practice, including family court strategy, civil trial techniques, tribunal advocacy, and insurance and consumer litigation. To address long-term sustainability, young advocates will also be supported through a Career Stability Toolkit, covering chamber management, ethical client intake, fee structuring, and reputation building.
By investing deliberately in the first five years of practice, this initiative aims to build a confident, competent, and ethically grounded generation of advocates—strengthening the Bar as a whole.

7.	Women’s Safety, Respect & Leadership

A Bar that does not protect and empower its women advocates cannot claim to be just or progressive. Women lawyers continue to face harassment, intimidation, exclusion from leadership, and informal segregation into limited practice areas, realities that undermine professional dignity and equal opportunity.
Adv. Geetha Raj is committed to fostering a court and Bar environment where women advocates practise with safety, respect, and confidence. She supports zero tolerance for harassment or intimidation within court premises or Bar institutions, and will work toward the establishment of structured support mechanisms for women advocates facing professional crises.
An internal rapid-response support system, complemented by peer-support and mentorship networks, will ensure that women advocates are not isolated when confronting harassment, bias, or professional obstruction. To address long-standing under-representation, she will advocate for meaningful participation of women advocates in committees and ADR panels, creating a sustainable leadership pipeline rather than symbolic inclusion.
Through targeted training, mentorship, and institutional support, women advocates will be encouraged and enabled to compete across all areas of practice, including criminal, constitutional, and commercial litigation, based on merit, not stereotypes. This commitment is aimed at building safer courts, equal opportunity, and a Bar where women’s voices shape the profession’s future.

8.	Mediation &Adr For Faster Justice 

Justice delayed erodes both dignity and faith in the legal system. As a trained mediator, Adv. Geetha Raj recognises that effective mediation and alternative dispute resolution (ADR) can significantly reduce case backlogs while preserving relationships and professional dignity.
She will promote mediation-readiness among advocates, focusing on negotiation skills, settlement drafting, and early identification of cases suitable for consensual resolution. Special emphasis will be placed on family disputes, such as custody, maintenance, and property matters, where timely and enforceable settlements prevent prolonged emotional and financial strain.
Adv. Geetha Raj will work to strengthen court-annexed mediation systems by improving coordination, scheduling discipline, and litigant awareness, ensuring that mediation referrals are meaningful and effective. These efforts align with the Mediation Act, 2023, which emphasises pre-litigation mediation and expeditious settlement.
By institutionalising ADR capacity within the Bar, her vision is to achieve speedy justice without compromising advocacy, reduce avoidable litigation, and contribute to easing the national case backlog.

9.	Pro Bono With Purpose

Access to justice must extend beyond ability to pay. Building on her long-standing commitment to pro bono service, Adv. Geetha Raj will work to institutionalise structured, accountable, and dignified legal aid within the Bar.
A coordinated pro bono engagement framework will match deserving litigants with willing advocates through Bar Associations and civil-society partners, ensuring that assistance is meaningful and outcomes-oriented rather than symbolic. Legal-literacy initiatives will empower citizens on issues such as domestic violence, senior-citizen rights, insurance claims, and maintenance.
Periodic One-Day Justice Camps, conducted in collaboration with local Bar Associations, will provide screening, guidance, and documentation support. Through these measures, pro bono work will function as a system of justice delivery, ensuring that legal aid reaches the last person with accountability and dignity.

10.	Professional Dignity

The dignity of advocates is inseparable from the dignity of the justice system. Every advocate is entitled to respect, within courts, before authorities, and within professional institutions.
Adv. Geetha Raj will work toward the adoption of an Advocates’ Dignity Charter, setting out clear standards of respectful conduct and institutional remedies for humiliation, unfair treatment, or professional obstruction. At the same time, she will support strict ethical discipline within the Bar, with zero tolerance for touting, impersonation, or unethical solicitation that undermines collective credibility.
Through structured engagement with courts and judicial administration, she will advocate for respectful court processes, including improved hearing management and professional address of advocates. By combining ethical accountability with institutional safeguards, this commitment seeks to elevate the profession’s standing and protect advocates from arbitrary treatment.

11.	Transparent Bar Administration

Transparency is the foundation of trust in any institution. A Bar Council that governs advocates must itself function in a manner that is open, accessible, and accountable.
Adv. Geetha Raj will work to ensure that all Bar Council rules, procedures, and fee structures, including those relating to enrolment, suspension, welfare benefits, and disciplinary processes, are clearly published and easily accessible in both Kannada and English, so that advocates can comply without intermediaries or informal channels. Plain-language guidance notes will accompany formal rules, reducing confusion and procedural dependency.
To minimise unnecessary travel and loss of professional time, she will advocate for district-level service camps enabling routine administrative updates, such as identity corrections, welfare nominations, and document submissions, to be completed locally. Regular and clear communication, including periodic public reporting on welfare disbursals and grievance-handling outcomes, will be encouraged to ensure institutional accountability.
Through these measures, the Bar Council will function in plain view of its members, restoring confidence that administrative processes are fair, predictable, and genuinely service-oriented.

12.	Legislative Advocacy For The Protection Of The Legal Profession : From Representation To Law-Making

i.	For decades, advocates have relied on fragmented protections under general criminal law, the Advocates Act, 1961, and ad-hoc executive assurances. These measures have failed to prevent impersonation, violence, intimidation, professional exploitation, and social insecurity faced by advocates.

ii.	Adv. Geetha Raj believes the time has come to move the Bar Council from passive representation to active law-making influence. Protection of advocates cannot remain a matter of resolutions and protests; it must be embedded in enforceable legislation and statutory frameworks.

iii.	As a Bar Council Member with legislative drafting expertise, institutional litigation experience, and direct engagement with public authorities, Geetha Raj will act as a policy driver, not a symbolic voice.

iv.	Karnataka Prohibition of Unauthorised Practice of Law (Fake Advocates) Act : Why Existing Law Has Failed. The Advocates Act, 1961 lacks independent enforcement machinery. Police treat impersonation as minor fraud, not systemic harm. Digital platforms enable mass impersonation with no deterrence. Genuine advocates lose livelihood and credibility 

v.	What the New Law Changes : The proposed law: Creates a stand-alone offence of unauthorised legal practice. Mandates technology-based verification (QR / smart ID), Imposes deterrent penalties and asset seizure, Recognises litigants as victims entitled to compensation,  Fixes responsibility on platforms enabling fake practice

vi.	How Geetha Raj Will Make This Law Happen, Geetha Raj will:
1.	Table the draft Bill formally before the KSBC, not as a suggestion but as a policy resolution.
2.	Secure Bar Council endorsement through documented data on impersonation cases.
3.	Trigger executive consultation with the Law & Home Departments by placing the Bill within the State’s legislative competence on: public order, fraud prevention, consumer protection, administration of justice.
4.	Use judicial-administrative leverage by engaging High Court administration on verification protocols, making legislative adoption operationally inevitable.
5.	Build consensus within the profession by engaging senior advocates and law universities, ensuring the law is seen as protective, not regulatory.
This is not advocacy for permission. it is preparation for enactment.
vii.	Karnataka Advocates’ Protection from Violence & Professional Intimidation Act :Violence against advocates is not a private crime.
It is an attack on the justice system itself.Systemic Failure:- FIRs are delayed or diluted, Attacks are trivialised as personal disputes, No recognition of advocate’s professional role, No uniform protocol across districts

viii.	Legislative Correction : Geetha Raj will push for a statutory framework that:
1.	Recognises attacks on advocates as justice-system offences
2.	Mandates time-bound FIR registration and investigation
3.	Provides special protection and compensation mechanisms
4.	Integrates medical, insurance, and welfare support
ix.	Geetha Raj’s Role
1.	Use Bar Council authority to force institutional coordination between Bar Associations, Police, and District Administration
2.	Place advocate protection within constitutional guarantees of life, dignity, and fair trial
3.	Build inter-State Bar Council alignment so Karnataka leads national reform

x.	Additional Legislative Agendas for the Benefit of Lawyers: Adv. Geetha Raj will not stop at two laws. Her legislative roadmap includes:
1.	Advocates’ Social Security & Pension Law
a.	Statutory pension framework for advocates
b.	Special safeguards for women advocates and career breaks
c.	Government co-contribution mechanisms
2.	Advocates’ Medical Insurance Support Act
a.	State-backed group medical insurance
b.	Emergency medical assistance for advocates and families
c.	Integration with welfare fund structures
3.	Advocates’ Workplace Safety & Court Infrastructure Norms
a.	Statutory safety standards in court premises
b.	Basic facilities for women advocates
c.	Accountability of court administrations
4.	Regulation of Online Legal Services
a.	Licensing and verification of digital legal platforms
b.	Protection of advocates from unfair competition and impersonation
c.	Consumer transparency and accountability

****

IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK
From Commitments to Irreversible Institutional Reform

Purpose and Governing Philosophy

This implementation framework is designed to convert professional commitments into institutional outcomes that cannot be diluted, delayed, or reversed. The emphasis is not on announcements or short-term optics, but on embedding reforms into Bar Council processes, resolutions, and inter-institutional engagements so that momentum continues irrespective of personalities.
Adv. Geetha Raj’s approach is grounded in institutional sequencing: first securing authority, then locking in process, and finally activating execution through formal mechanisms of the Bar Council, the judiciary, and the State.
I. Institutionalisation of Advocate Welfare Systems
i.	The first pillar of implementation is the transformation of welfare from an ad-hoc benefit mechanism into a predictable, rule-governed institutional system.
ii.	Advocate welfare access mechanisms will be formally institutionalised through Bar Council processes, including:
1.	establishment of welfare-access facilitation structures at Bar Association levels,
2.	formal adoption of a standardised welfare claim pathway clearly delineating stages of submission, scrutiny, approval, and disbursal,
3.	incorporation of defined accountability and escalation mechanisms to address delays.
iii.	Special emphasis will be placed on welfare benefits to advocates and their families, with a dedicated focus on families of deceased advocates, ensuring priority handling, sensitive engagement, and continuity of support.
iv.	Through these measures, welfare will cease to be discretionary or intermediary-driven and will operate as a rights-based, systematised function of the Bar Council.
II. Structured Capacity-Building for Young Advocates
i.	Adv. Geetha Raj’s implementation strategy recognises that professional sustainability begins with early institutional support, not informal patronage.
ii.	A formally structured mentorship and capacity-building framework will be embedded within Bar Council functioning, ensuring:
1.	predictable and periodic skill-development modules,
2.	direct engagement of experienced practitioners across practice areas,
3.	continuity in training standards rather than sporadic sessions.
iii.	This framework will be designed to function independently of individual access or chance, ensuring that young advocates across districts know where, when, and how professional skills can be acquired.
iv.	The objective is not episodic training, but the creation of a professional pipeline that strengthens the Bar across generations.
III. Women Advocates’ Safety, Support & Leadership Integration
i.	Implementation in this domain will move beyond reactive support and symbolic representation.
ii.	A formal Women Advocates’ Support and Response Framework will be embedded institutionally, providing:
1.	defined reporting and support pathways,
2.	structured coordination with Bar Associations and relevant authorities,
3.	internal mechanisms to address harassment, intimidation, or professional exclusion.
iii.	Simultaneously, representation of women advocates within committees, ADR panels, and institutional roles will be systematically integrated, ensuring leadership participation is structural rather than discretionary.
iv.	This approach ensures that women advocates are protected, supported, and positioned as decision-makers within the profession, not merely beneficiaries of welfare.
IV. Health, Insurance & Pension Security-Policy-to-Framework Transition
i.	Rather than announcing schemes prematurely, Adv. Geetha Raj’s implementation model focuses on framework-building before rollout.
ii.	Structured policy consultations will be institutionalised with:
1.	insurance providers,
2.	actuarial experts,
3.	senior members of the Bar,
4.	Bar Associations across districts.
iii.	These consultations will culminate in drafted, consultative frameworks for:
1.	group medical insurance for advocates and their families,
2.	pension and post-practice security models with safeguards for women advocates and career interruptions.
iv.	By anchoring these initiatives in formal policy models and Bar Council deliberation, health and retirement security will progress as sustainable institutional reforms, not fragmented or goodwill-based schemes.
V. Legislative Advocacy as an Institutional Function
i.	A defining feature of this implementation plan is the conversion of legislative advocacy into a formal Bar Council function, not an external campaign.
ii.	Through formal resolutions and documented institutional positions, the Bar Council will:
1.	endorse and own key legislative proposals, including laws addressing fake advocates, advocate protection from violence, and professional social security,
2.	initiate structured engagement with State departments through official channels,
3.	place the Bar Council on record as a policy stakeholder, not merely a pressure group.
iii.	This approach ensures that legislative reform begins as a Bar Council mandate, making disengagement or delay by the State institutionally and politically costly.
VI. Mediation & ADR Capacity Integration
i.	Implementation in mediation and ADR will focus on professional readiness, not dilution of advocacy.
ii.	Adv. Geetha Raj will ensure that mediation-readiness becomes part of professional capacity-building, equipping advocates with:
1.	negotiation competence,
2.	settlement drafting skills,
3.	informed case selection for consensual resolution.
iii.	This integration aligns with evolving statutory frameworks while protecting the advocate’s central role in dispute resolution. Mediation is positioned not as an alternative to advocacy, but as an extension of professional skill and client service.
VII. Transparent and Accountable Bar Administration
i.	Transparency reforms will be embedded through:
1.	formal publication of rules, procedures, and fee structures in accessible formats and languages,
2.	decentralisation of routine administrative services through structured district-level engagement,
3.	institutional reporting practices that allow members to assess performance without informal channels.
ii.	The objective is to make Bar Council administration predictable, visible, and service-oriented, reducing dependency, discretion, and opacity.
Outcome of the Implementation Framework
i.	Through this phased, institutional approach:
1.	welfare access becomes reliable and family-inclusive,
2.	professional training becomes structured and continuous,
3.	women advocates gain safety and leadership integration,
4.	insurance and pension security move from aspiration to policy frameworks,
5.	legislative reform becomes an institutional inevitability,
6.	mediation and ADR strengthen, rather than weaken, advocacy,
7.	and Bar Council administration functions in plain view of its members.
Why This Framework Cannot Be Replicated Casually
i.	This implementation model:
a.	requires legislative drafting literacy,
b.	demands institutional negotiation experience,
c.	relies on cross-domain expertise (insurance, public law, mediation),and operates through process-locking rather than promises.
ii.	It is not a manifesto designed for applause.
It is a governing architecture designed for delivery.
“My commitment is not to complete terms, but to complete reforms, by embedding them into institutions so deeply that they outlast individuals.” - Adv. Geetha Raj

# ADV. GEETHA RAJ
## MANIFESTO FOR THE BAR

**"Welfare with Dignity • Justice with Speed • Practice with Protection"**

---

## VISION STATEMENT

Adv. Geetha Raj envisions a progressive, accountable, and future-ready Bar Council that genuinely protects its members while strengthening the delivery of justice. Under the guiding banner **"Welfare with Dignity. Justice with Speed. Practice with Protection,"** her vision is to build a Bar where every advocate, and every advocate's family, is treated with respect, fairness, and urgency.

This vision bridges modern advocacy with grassroots support, ensuring that even the most vulnerable lawyers have swift access to welfare benefits, comprehensive health security, and meaningful post-practice protection. It is a vision of courts where women advocates work in safe and inclusive environments, young lawyers are mentored rather than marginalised, and dispute resolution is efficient, ethical, and dignified.

> **A future-ready Bar must protect advocates not only in court, but in health, hardship, and retirement. Welfare without security is incomplete.**

---

## MISSION STATEMENT

Adv. Geetha Raj's mission is to translate vision into action by reforming Bar welfare systems, strengthening professional security, mentoring the next generation of advocates, and streamlining the administration of justice. Drawing on her decades of courtroom experience, institutional representation, and insurance-law expertise, she will work to deliver measurable outcomes rather than rhetoric.

Her mission includes:

- **Modernising Bar administration** through transparency and technology
- **Establishing robust support structures** for young and women advocates
- **Institutionalising health insurance, pension security, and advocate-protection frameworks**
- **Strengthening mediation and pro bono services** so that justice reaches every citizen

Through accountable governance and consistent engagement with Bar Associations and government institutions, she aims to restore trust in the Bar Council as a body that serves, protects, and empowers its members.

## Institutional Leadership & Professional Recognition

Early in her professional career, Adv. Geetha Raj was elected as an Office Bearer of the Indian Federation of Women Lawyers (IFWL), through a democratic process among its members. During her tenure, she actively contributed to strengthening professional capacity within the Bar by organising multiple workshops and training programmes for advocates across Karnataka, in collaboration with the Karnataka Judicial Academy. These initiatives focused on practical courtroom skills, legal updates, and professional development, reflecting her early and sustained commitment to collective institutional growth and peer-driven leadership.

Adv. Geetha Raj currently serves her second consecutive term as an elected Director on the Board of Nyayamitra Sahakari Bank, a cooperative bank established and run by the advocate fraternity. Her election to the Board through member voting reflects the trust and confidence reposed in her by the advocate community. During her tenure, she has been actively involved in streamlining banking operations, strengthening internal governance, and improving service delivery to advocate-members.

Under the collective stewardship of the Board, the Bank has:
1. expanded financial support to members through housing loans, mortgage loans, and auto loans,
2. ⁠enhanced individual and group loan limits to better meet members’ professional and personal needs,
3. ⁠improved operational efficiency and financial discipline, and
4. ⁠achieved sustained profitability, enabling the declaration of 16% dividends to its members.

## CORE COMMITMENTS

### 1. WELFARE THAT WORKS

The Karnataka Advocates' Welfare Fund has great potential but needs overhaul. Geetha will ensure:

- **Time-bound claim processing:** Defining each step (submission, scrutiny, approval, disbursal) with strict timelines and an escalation channel
- **Welfare Helpdesks at Bar Associations:** On-site assistance for nominee updates, ID corrections, and guidance (following the successful doorstep-service model in Mysuru)
- **Family-First Protocol:** Assisting dependents of deceased advocates with paperwork and fast access to benefits
- **"Know Your Welfare Rights" literacy drives:** Ensuring no lawyer loses entitlements to simple procedural errors

---

### 2. COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR ADVOCATES AND DEPENDENTS

Adv. Geetha Raj will actively work toward the introduction of **Bar-wide group medical insurance schemes** covering advocates, their spouses, children, and dependent parents.

#### Key Features:

- **Negotiated group Mediclaim policies** with both public and private insurance companies
- **Lower premiums** through pooled risk
- **Broader coverage** including hospitalization, critical illness and maternity benefits
- **Cashless treatment** across major hospital networks

#### Structured Options:

Recognising the diversity within the Bar, the scheme will be structured with **tiered insurance options**, allowing young advocates, senior advocates, and women advocates to opt for coverage that suits their stage of life and professional capacity.

**Continuity of coverage** will be a core principle, ensuring that advocates are not excluded during periods of illness, maternity, or temporary suspension of practice.

> As a practising insurance lawyer representing life and insurance companies, Adv. Geetha Raj brings rare, hands-on expertise in structuring group insurance products, negotiating policy terms, and ensuring that claims are honoured in practice, not merely promised on paper.

---

### 3. PENSION AND POST-PRACTICE SECURITY FOR ADVOCATES

The belief that an advocate can or should practice until death is neither humane nor realistic. A profession that speaks for justice must also ensure dignity and security for its own members in their later years.

Adv. Geetha Raj will initiate structured dialogue and policy development to evolve a **Pension and Retirement Security Model** for advocates.

#### Proposed Modalities:

- **Voluntary or semi-mandatory pension contributions** routed through the Advocates' Welfare Fund during active years of practice
- **Opt-in pension tiers** based on years of practice and contribution capacity
- **Special pension safeguards for women advocates**, particularly those who experience career breaks due to marriage, maternity, or caregiving responsibilities
- **Clear exit and transition mechanisms**, including voluntary surrender or dormancy of the Sanad upon retirement and eligibility-based activation of pension benefits thereafter

> The objective is security with dignity, not coercion.

---

### 4. PRESSURING THE STATE FOR STATUTORY PROTECTION

Medical insurance and pension security for advocates cannot depend solely on goodwill or fragmented schemes; they require **statutory recognition and policy backing**.

Adv. Geetha Raj commits to using the institutional strength of the Bar Council to actively engage and pressurise the State Government for:

- Statutory medical insurance support for advocates
- Government participation or subsidies in advocate pension schemes
- Formal recognition of advocates as a professional class deserving social security protection

She will also coordinate with other State Bar Councils to build a **national advocacy framework** aimed at long-term legislative protection for lawyers.

> Advocates protect the justice system; the justice system, in turn, must protect advocates.

---

### 5. ADVOCATE PROTECTION AND SECURITY FRAMEWORK

Financial security alone is insufficient if advocates remain vulnerable to physical threats and professional intimidation. Alongside health and pension security, Adv. Geetha Raj will work toward the establishment of a formal **Advocate Protection Framework**.

This framework will include:

- Institutional responses to threats, harassment, and violence against advocates
- Structured coordination with police and district administrations
- Clear protocols to be triggered when advocates are targeted for their professional work
- Strong and consistent representation before the government and judiciary to reinforce **zero tolerance** for attacks on advocates

---

### 6. YOUNG ADVOCATES FIRST

Early-career lawyers need real skills and support, not just speeches. Geetha will launch:

#### Mentorship Network
Pairing senior and junior lawyers to teach courtroom drafting, procedure, and ethics.

#### Practice-Support Clinics
Regular sessions covering:
- Family court strategy
- Civil trial techniques (from pleadings to evidence and argument)
- Tribunal practice
- Handling insurance/consumer claims

#### Career Stability Toolkit
Training on:
- Chamber management
- Ethical client intake
- Fee-setting
- Reputation-building

> By investing in the first five years of an advocate's career, this commitment pays dividends in competence and confidence for the entire Bar.

---

### 7. WOMEN'S SAFETY, RESPECT & LEADERSHIP

Geetha will foster a court environment where women lawyers feel safe and empowered:

- **Zero tolerance** for any harassment or intimidation in court or Bar premises
- **Rapid-response support cell** to guide and assist any woman facing crisis
- **Peer-support circles** for professional solidarity
- **At least 30% of committee and ADR-panel seats reserved for women**, creating a leadership pipeline
- **Training and mentorship** to help women compete for the toughest cases (criminal, constitutional, commercial)

> A recent SCBA survey found 57.8% of women lawyers report unequal leadership opportunities and many still face bias or disrespect in court. This commitment means safer courts and equal voice for women, backed by concrete support structures.

---

### 8. MEDIATION & ADR FOR FASTER JUSTICE

As a trained mediator, Geetha knows that amicable settlements can cut case backlogs and preserve dignity.

#### Mediation-Readiness for Lawyers:
- Training on negotiation tactics
- Settlement drafting
- Recognizing viable cases

#### Special Programs:
Focus on family disputes (custody, maintenance, property) to reach enforceable agreements and avoid repeat litigation.

#### Strengthening Court-Annexed Mediation:
- Improving coordination and scheduling
- Educating litigants about mediation options

> This aligns with the new Mediation Act (2023) which mandates pre-litigation mediation and fast-track settlements. By embracing ADR, her Bar Council aims to reduce our 4.5 crore-case backlog and deliver speedy justice without sacrificing advocacy.

---

### 9. PRO BONO WITH PURPOSE

Building on her own long-term pro bono work, Geetha will scale a structured legal-aid system:

- **Centralized pro bono roster** coordinated with Bar Associations and NGOs to match deserving clients to willing advocates
- **Legal-literacy camps** on key issues (domestic violence, senior rights, insurance claims, maintenance, etc.)
- **"One-Day Justice Camps"** in collaboration with local Bars for on-the-spot screening, advice, and documentation help

> Recent data show legal-aid beneficiaries now outnumber the total of the previous 30 years. These measures ensure that "justice reaches the last person" as promised.

---

### 10. PROFESSIONAL DIGNITY

Every lawyer deserves respect. Geetha will:

- Develop an **Advocates' Dignity Charter** with clear guidelines and remedies for any humiliation or unfair treatment
- Enforce **strict ethical standards** within the Bar: zero tolerance for touting, impersonation or unethical solicitation
- Work with courts to ensure **respectful court processes** (better time-management, proper forms of address)

> By combining firm standards with internal awareness programs, she will elevate the profession's esteem and protect advocates from arbitrary treatment.

---

### 11. TRANSPARENT BAR ADMINISTRATION

Transparency builds trust. Geetha will:

- **Publish all rules and fees** (membership, suspension, benefits) in Kannada and English
- Provide **simplified guidance notes** explaining rules plainly
- Extend the **"doorstep" model of service** beyond Mysuru through district-level camps
- Issue **quarterly reports** on welfare-fund disbursals and grievance-handling statistics

> These steps ensure the Bar Council works in plain view, restoring faith that "the system is working for us."

---

### 12. LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY FOR PROTECTION OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION

#### A. Karnataka Prohibition of Unauthorised Practice of Law (Fake Advocates) Bill, 2025

The growing menace of fake advocates poses a direct threat to the integrity of the justice delivery system, the livelihood of genuine advocates, and the confidence of litigants.

**Adv. Geetha Raj will:**

- Actively pursue the enactment and enforcement of this comprehensive Bill
- Place the Bill formally before the Karnataka State Bar Council
- Secure institutional endorsement and recommendation to the State Government
- Engage directly with the Law Department and Home Department
- Compile data from Bar Associations and courts regarding impersonation cases
- Work with the High Court administration to prepare for implementation through:
  - Advocate verification mechanisms
  - QR-code based identity checks
  - Mandatory reporting protocols

> This law protects genuine advocates rather than regulating them, ensuring both legislative acceptance and smooth enforcement.

#### B. Karnataka Advocates' Protection from Violence and Social Welfare (Amendment) Bill, 2025

Incidents of violence, intimidation, and threats against advocates have become a serious and recurring concern across the State.

**Adv. Geetha Raj will:**

- Work relentlessly for the enactment of this Bill providing statutory protection to advocates
- Frame advocate protection as a matter of constitutional importance
- Push for structured coordination between Bar Associations, police, and district administrations
- Ensure mandatory protocols recognising attacks on advocates as offences affecting the justice system
- Integrate advocate protection with welfare measures (medical assistance, insurance, compensation)
- Create inter-State momentum for uniform advocate-protection legislation

> A legal profession that functions under fear cannot discharge its constitutional role with courage and integrity.
